    "# 1. Problem Description and Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This mini-project participates in the Kaggle challenge “Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets.”\n",
    "The goal is to classify tweets into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1` → the tweet refers to a real disaster\n",
    "- `0` → the tweet does not refer to a real disaster (jokes, metaphors, news headlines, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a standard supervised NLP text classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is NLP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves techniques that allow computers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- interpret text,\n",
    "- extract semantic meaning,\n",
    "- analyze patterns,\n",
    "- and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, raw text must be transformed into numerical vectors (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings) so that a machine learning model can process it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "`train.csv` contains the labeled data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column     | Description |\n",
    "|------------|-------------|\n",
    "| id         | Tweet ID |\n",
    "| keyword    | Optional keyword (frequently missing) |\n",
    "| location   | Noisy text, often missing |\n",
    "| text       | The tweet content |\n",
    "| target     | 1 = disaster, 0 = not disaster |\n",
    "\n",
    "`test.csv` contains the same structure without the `target` column.\n",
